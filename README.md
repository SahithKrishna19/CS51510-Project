# CS51510-Project

## Installation
Download and install the appropriate Java Development Kit (JDK) for your operating system, set the necessary environment variables (e.g., JAVA_HOME and PATH), and verify the installation using java -version in the terminal or command prompt.

## Description
Our project delves into the world of graph algorithms, integral to Data Structures. Drawing from deep interdisciplinary research, these visually appealing algorithms, exemplified by Google Maps, find application in real-life scenarios. Focused on implementing graph algorithms and engineering heuristics, our project creates a geographical map of US Central Time Zone cities. Interconnected by directed links reflecting distance as the primary cost, the project evaluates traversal costs considering topological, environmental, and human-centric factors. Using optimal data structures like priority queues, hash maps, and binary trees, algorithms such as Prim's, Kruskal's MST, BFS, Djikstra, and Bellman Ford address diverse use cases, reflecting adaptability to real-world scenarios
